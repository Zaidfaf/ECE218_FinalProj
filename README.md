**Windshield Wiper System**

This project prototypes the windshield wiper system of a motor vehicle. It allows a user to select from four windshield wiper modes,
OFF, LOW, INTERMITTENT, and HIGH. In the INTERMITTENT mode, the wipers pause in between sweeps based on a user selected delay time of
SHORT, MEDIUM, or LONG. In the LOW and HIGH modes, the windhsield wipers move at different speeds, roughly 30 and 40 rpm respectively.
All information about the current mode of the wipers is displayed to the user and a mock ignition system is included in the prototype.
